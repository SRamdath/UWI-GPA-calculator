Written by Simon Ramdath in year 2 of UWI, which is about 6 years ago? Interestingly, implementing option 3 wasn't too trivial. Its like those fill the boxes problems.

Grade   | Quality Points | Marks Range
--------------------------------------
A+      | 4.3            | 90-100
A       | 4.0            | 80-89
A-      | 3.7            | 75-79
B+      | 3.3            | 70-74
B       | 3.0            | 65-69
B-      | 2.7            | 60-64
C+      | 2.3            | 55-59

To calculate the grades needed to achieve a target GPA, imagine that you’re filling up new "boxes" with grades. These new boxes represent the number of courses you plan to take. Your current GPA is based on the grades already in your existing boxes, and your target GPA determines the average value you want across all boxes—both old and new.

The process involves:

1)Calculating the total GPA points required to meet your target across all boxes.
2)Subtracting the GPA points you’ve already earned (from existing courses).
3)Distributing the remaining GPA points evenly among the new courses.
If the target average requires grades beyond the maximum possible (e.g., all A+ grades), it’s not achievable with the given number of courses. Otherwise, you'll calculate the specific grades or GPA range needed for each new course to meet the goal.

What makes it difficult is mapping the grades to their equivalent numerical gpa which can either vary by 0.3 or 0.4, meaning that natural solutions may not be optimal. We can solve this by storing the excess grade points and distributing them to correspond with another letter grade.
